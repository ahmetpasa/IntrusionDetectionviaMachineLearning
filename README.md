# IntrusionDetectionviaMachineLearning
This is a research project about Intrusion Detection via Machine Learning. I tested different algorithms and some class imbalance strategies to find the most appropriate method for intrusion detection.

In "totalresults.xlsx", you can see the performance results for this research in one table. Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, TPR, FPR.

In "papertable.xlsx", you can see the literature review, done for this project. You can see the algorithms and their accuracy, FPR and TPR rates.(If they're written in source paper)
